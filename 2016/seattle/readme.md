# Notes

Our format last year was to have four projects, one per room, and rotate groups of 25 from one room to another on an hourly basis. With an hour for lunch and 10 minutes between rooms for rotation and reset, this made a 5.5 hour day.

This is an event for Seattle *kids* being organized by [Seattle CoderDojo](http://www.seattlecoderdojo.com). Parents are encouraged to participate with their children, but only the children are *guaranteed* a seat and workspace at the project tables. Adults can also participate as mentors/facilitators.

ADDITIONAL ORGANIZERS WELCOME, VOLUNTEERS TO TEACH/FACILITATE WELCOME.
